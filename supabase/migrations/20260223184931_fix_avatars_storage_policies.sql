  # Fix avatars storage bucket RLS policies

  ## Problem
  The INSERT policy allowed any authenticated user to upload anywhere in the bucket.
  The UPDATE policy had no WITH CHECK clause, causing upsert (INSERT + UPDATE) to fail.

  ## Changes
  - Drop and recreate all avatars storage policies with proper ownership checks
  - INSERT: users can only upload to their own folder (auth.uid() = folder name)
  - UPDATE: users can only update files in their own folder (with both USING and WITH CHECK)
  - DELETE: unchanged, users can only delete their own files
  - SELECT: public read access unchanged
